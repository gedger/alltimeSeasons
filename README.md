# alltimeSeasons skin

## Summary
These files modify the included weewx skin Seasons to include all-time data. 

## Overview
I wanted to be able to compare the rainfall in May with rainfall last year, well in fact all the years my weather station has been operating. 
I also wanted to able to compare temperature and perhaps wind. Surprisingly the standard weewx installation doesnt include this facility but 
due to its excellent design it's fairly straightforward to add a new skin to do what you want. I really liked the, no standard, Season skin so I used 
that as a starting point. Here are some screen shots of the results.
